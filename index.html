      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Breland Norwood, and I am a passionate Web Development and Design major at the University of
        Arkansas at Little Rock. Ever since I discovered the intricate world of website creation, I have been captivated
        by the possibilities of combining creativity, technical expertise, and user experience to create stunning
        digital masterpieces.

        Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my skills in various programming languages such as HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript, as well as gained expertise in popular web frameworks and libraries like Bootstrap. In addition to my technical knowledge, I have a keen eye for design, which allows me to
        create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces that effectively communicate the intended message.
